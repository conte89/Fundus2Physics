# Fundus2Physics
Clinical fundus photography is ubiquitous, fast, and inexpensive, yet its interpretation remains largely qualitative. We introduce a lightweight image-to-physics workflow that turns a single, segmented fundus image into spatially resolved biophysical inputs and model outputs relevant to retinal physiology and age-related macular degeneration (AMD). From the binary vasculature we derive local vessel radius and a permeability map that varies along each branch; an optional macular “hot-spot” represents neovascular leakage. Because capillaries are not visible in standard fundus images, we incorporate an implicit capillary correction that limits the effective exchange distance to realistic, layer-appropriate values (tighter outside the foveal avascular zone, looser within it). These maps are imported into a COMSOL transport model where vessels act as boundary sources and the retina is treated as a porous diffusive medium for albumin. We report two complementary indices on a 0–1 scale: a structural risk that reflects anatomy and material properties, and a dynamic risk that also accounts for the evolving concentration field, naturally decreasing in regions the diffusing solute has not yet reached (e.g., early times near the no-flux outer rim). Applied to real fundus geometries, the framework recovers expected trends—higher leak along thin branches, spatially heterogeneous transport around the macula—and supports sensitivity analyses over permeability, uptake, and capillary scale assumptions. The result is a reproducible, quantitative bridge between routine imaging and predictive transport modeling that can inform hypothesis testing, phenotype comparison, and scenario exploration in AMD without requiring specialized acquisitions or manual vessel labeling.
